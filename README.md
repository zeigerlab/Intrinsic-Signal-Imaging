# Intrinsic-Signal-Imaging
Code &amp; Apps for Running and analyzing intrinsic signal imaging experiments

For users setting up IOSI, start with the 'IOSI_RingLED_IlluminationBuild.docx' document to get your illumination set up. This can then be controlled using the MATLAB application 'NeopixelControl.mlapp'.

Once you have started acquiring images, use the image processing application to generate basic deltaR/R images and overlay of IOSI signals onto images of cortical vasculature. Use the MATLAB application 'iosgui.mlapp'. This app requires the additional script 'IOSGUI_ImageAnalysis.m', which does most of the image processing.
